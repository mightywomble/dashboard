# Dashboard Improvements

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Font Loading Issues
- **Problem**: Inter font from Google Fonts was not loading properly, causing text to appear with poor fallback fonts

- **Better hover states** with subtle transform animations
- **Improved input styling** with the new `.glass-input` class

  - Fixed form submission handling to prevent visual glitches

### 4. Form Improvements
